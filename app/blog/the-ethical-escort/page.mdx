# The Ethical Escort

Here, words like *trust* aren't declared; they're demonstrated. In this work, proof reads quietly:
**over a decade** spent refining the same craft every day. Discipline became intuition. Detail became ease.

I don't promise anything I can't deliver—and I don't sell what I can't stand behind. My clients are logic-driven,
time-poor, and privacy-serious. They don't need spectacle. They need clarity, composure, and a companion who
anticipates without intruding.

Like a three-star service that never interrupts a sentence mid-thought, I read the room—then I remove friction.
Attire, setting, timing: aligned to who *you* are, not a template. If you prefer daylight lunches, we keep daylight.
If you prefer quiet, I choose rooms where quiet is the point. It isn't magic. It's repetition—eleven years of it.

There's a reason the best work feels "intuitive": it's practice plus observation, compounded. Think of how great software
learns patterns to answer precisely. Humans do this too, just more discreetly: pattern → inference → preparation → ease.

## What that means for you

- **Continuity without re-explaining.** I retain preferences; you keep momentum.  
- **Preparation you don't have to ask for.** The right table. The right cadence. The right exit.  
- **Tax-compliant invoicing.** Your monthly arrangement is billed through my S corp for administrative ease.  

You won't see scarcity language here. You'll see an invitation to **inquire**—when the timing, and the fit, are right.

*For over a decade, I've refined this craft through daily repetition and careful attention. That longevity is the proof.
Mastery is the promise I deliver.*
