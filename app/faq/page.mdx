# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where's the line between dinner and an overnight?
**Dinner/Evening** is a full, unhurried block (naturally 5–6 hours).  
If our evening **continues into the morning**, it becomes an **Overnight**.  
No stopwatch—just a clear boundary so we both relax into the experience.

---

### Do you offer a "one-hour" meeting?
I don't slice minutes. If you prefer something brief, I offer **Cocktails & Conversation**—an elegant **1–2 hour** introduction over champagne or a cocktail.

---

### Is lunch different from dinner?
The craft is the same—only the setting changes. Daylight doesn't shorten the rhythm.  
**Luncheon** follows the same three-part flow as dinner: a glass to begin, a meal or outing in the middle, a quiet close.

---

### What do you mean by "continuity"?
Continuity means I retain your preferences—pace, settings, rhythms—so each meeting starts at your cruising altitude without re-explaining. Over time, discipline becomes intuition.

---

### How do Arrangements work?
Arrangements are for clients who prefer ongoing continuity and **priority access**.  
I hold a **limited number (four or five at most)** at any time. Each is crafted individually around cadence and cities.

**Professional billing:** Arrangements are **invoiced through my S corp**—clean, discrete, and **tax-compliant**.  
For many clients, this allows the expense to be offset against income—efficiency, not indulgence.

---

### Do unused meetings carry over?
No. The calendar stays clean so preparation stays precise.

---

### Are weekends strictly timed?
A **Weekend** is immersion, not a countdown—two nights and the days between. Real life (flights, delays) is designed around, not penalized.

---

### How do I begin?
Start with a brief introduction on the **[Inquire](/inquire)** page—first name, preferred city, and whether you're drawn to cocktails, luncheon/dinner, overnight, weekend, or an arrangement. I'll respond with thoughtful next steps.
