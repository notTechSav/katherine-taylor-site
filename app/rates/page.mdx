# Rates

Like Hermès, some offerings are clearly listed while others are arranged with inquiry.  
This is not a menu of hours; it is a small collection of experiences.

<hr className="my-10 border-neutral-200" />

### Cocktails & Conversation — $3,000
An elegant introduction: **1–2 hours** over champagne or a cocktail.  
Long enough to connect, never rushed, and always unhurried.

<hr className="my-10 border-neutral-200" />

### Luncheon or Evening Together — $8,000
A curated block built around a three-part rhythm — a glass to begin, a meal or outing in the middle, and a nightcap to close.  
Naturally **5–6 hours**; no stopwatch required.  
**If our evening continues into the morning, it becomes an Overnight.**

<hr className="my-10 border-neutral-200" />

### Overnight Continuity — $10,000
A full night together, with the ease of waking unhurried and carrying the rhythm through morning.

<hr className="my-10 border-neutral-200" />

### Weekend Immersion — $20,000
Two nights and the days in between — immersion without clock-watching.  
Travel is real life; delays and shifting schedules are designed around, not penalized.  

Because of the preparation and presence involved, only a small number of weekends are offered each season.

<hr className="my-10 border-neutral-200" />

### Arrangements — Inquire
For those who prefer continuity, I hold a limited number of **Arrangements** at a time (no more than four or five).  
Each is crafted individually, offering priority scheduling, seamless continuity, and the intuition that comes from being known.  

Arrangements are **invoiced through my S corp**, providing the ease of professional, tax-compliant billing.  
For many clients, this means the expense is offset against income — making the experience not indulgence, but efficiency.

## Additional Notes

- **Friends**  
  Arrangements for more than two require symmetry. If you'd like to include a friend, the honorarium is matched for each lady, and the experience is curated with care for all involved.

- **Outcalls & Hosting**  
  Outcalls are welcomed at five-star hotels only.  
  Hosting is possible with a discreet setting; a hosting fee (typically $500–$2,000 depending on arrangements) applies.

- **Travel**  
  Travel is welcomed and planned in advance. Business or first-class flights and accommodations are provided, with a modest travel honorarium added.  
  Delays are absorbed gracefully—the rhythm matters more than the clock.

- **Extensions**  
  Evenings often flow beyond their frame. If our time continues into morning, it becomes an **Overnight**. Extensions within the same cadence are arranged at my discretion.
