# About

Like the golden ratio, elegance arises from proportion and discipline.  
For over a decade, I've refined this craft the same way an artisan refines their art — through daily repetition, observation, and care. Discipline became intuition. Detail became ease.

## Philosophy

The Experience is not about hours or transactions.  
It is about continuity: holding space so you never re-explain, preparing so you never wait, and tailoring so you feel seen without having to ask.

I describe it as **intuition** — not guesswork, but refinement through thousands of data points over years.  
The effect is subtle: a table chosen before you arrive, a rhythm of three — champagne, dinner, nightcap — flowing without friction.

---

## Continuity

I hold a limited number of arrangements at any time — never more than four or five.  
This ensures the work remains intuitive and the preparation invisible.  
It is both personal and professional: invoiced through my S corp, discreet, and tax-compliant.

*Mastery is the promise I deliver. Continuity is the way it is felt.*
